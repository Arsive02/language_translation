        "title": "GREEK EYES ON US",
        "description": "Around the late eighth century B.C.E. (800-701), Mediterranean cultures developed coinage. Soon after, coins were widely used and minted in as many as 700 independent poleis (Greek city-states). Some poleis used specific imagery, while others embraced variable designs depending on artists' and patrons' whimsy. This exhibit of 10 silver coins illustrates an especially engaging characteristic of ancient Greek coinage, eyes looking toward us, a direct personal connection infrequent in coinage of any era. It is delightful to return the gaze!"

        "description": "Coins in the ancient Roman world were art objects created in stages. Engravers carved the approved designs onto two dies, one for the obverse and a second for the reverse of each coin. The designs were struck by hand onto carefully weighed discs of gold, silver, bronze and other metals. The designs on Roman coins were created to respond to current events and to convey official messages from government and mint officials. Since propagandistic themes were expected to be longer-lived than money that contained familiar themes with new content. The art on Roman coins was akin to jewelry--immediate and intimate."

        "description": "This exhibition highlights three themes of Roman coins: military success, religious piety and family. In ancient Rome, there was no separation of politics from the army or from religion. Military command was a token of political power. Since many recipients of Roman coins were soldiers, these themes were selected to encourage loyalty among the troops. In addition, a Roman leader's status was promoted through familial connections, both human and divine."

        "title": "Terracotta Vase",
        "description": "Andrea Gill creates ceramic vessels that comment on functionality by combining form and decoration. Gill's background in painting is evident in the decorative surfaces that accentuate the forms she creates. An inexpensive material, Gill uses earthenware exclusively to create two-dimensional surfaces for the decoration in each work. This tall, eccentric vase emphasizes the exchange of form and function, captivating the viewer with its elaborate design. Its earth-toned color palette alludes to the materiality of the vessel, and the floral decoration touches on the function of the vase. Gill's decoration develops during the creation of each piece—each step informing the next, adjusting to create harmony between form and surface."

        "title": "Inflammatory Essays",
        "description": "Originally designed as wheat-paste posters for New York City streets, these Inflammatory Essays use direct language, bold capital letters, and brightly colored paper to grab viewer attention. Each of the 29 essays contains 100 words, spread over 20 lines. Holzer located the essays throughout the city based on their content. The essay content is confrontational, with some essays using language from ideological extremes to contradict others. Blending conceptual and street art, while adopting the techniques of manifestos and advertising, Holzer aimed to communicate directly with a wide audience."

        "title": "Following Sun",
        "description": "Transformation stories underpin origin myths passed down through generations of Indigenous peoples living across Canada and the United States. Both entertaining and instructional, these stories connect the natural and spirit worlds. This print depicts an Inuit tale about the creation of the sun and moon by a competitive brother and sister with contrasting temperaments. In the story, the sister challenges her brother to transform, suggesting various Arctic animals, including a bear, eagle, and wolf. As they chase each other around their igloo, the siblings assume the form of different animals, until the sister grabs a torch and ascends into the heavens to become the sun. Not to be outdone, the brother follows with a silvery flame, becoming the moon. Karpik's artwork shows the sister sun smiling wryly at her brother, as he transforms, rising over the white expanse of the page."

        "title": "Xiao Lu",
        "description": "In this work, the artist memorializes two dead fawns discovered on walks around their home. The artist studied the animals and recalled: \"Inside the Dunhuang grottoes there are ancient Buddhist murals, always depicting apsaras—flying angels without wings. From some angles, the deer looked just like those apsaras caught in mid-flight ascending to heaven.\" Printed on three sheets, the artwork shows the fawns in a weightless, tumbling sequence. Each image is accompanied by a circle with trailing pigment drips. These circles hold multiple meanings, symbolizing the cyclical nature of life and time, Zen Buddhist concepts of emptiness and completeness, and the full-stop circle in Chinese writing."

        "title": "From Me, All Things Proceed and to Me, They Must Return",
        "description": "From 1991 breast cancer recurrence until 2001, the artist's artworks center her experience living with cancer, conveying lived experience through landscape. A roaring waterfall takes up the entirety of the print, overwhelming the composition with rushing water. The subtle shifts in the color of the falling water create a sense of power and movement, transporting viewers into the raging current. The meditative nature and force of the waterfall becomes a metaphor for accepting and letting go in the face of a terminal diagnosis."

        "description": "In Look at Me Like You Love Me, the series photographs a diverse group of queer and gender-nonconforming people. Despite different genders, races, sexualities, and ages, each person shares feelings of wanting to be loved and cared for. In this portrait, the couple embrace. Their direct gazes assert that they stand together, united, while the yellow flowers in the background evoke joy and celebration."

        "description": "In To Survive on this Shore, the series explores the silenced stories of middle-aged and elderly transgender and gender-nonconforming people. As a couple, Debbie has supported Danny through his transition and medical disability. Danny identifies as a trans man who began his transition at age 64. However, he had to stop his testosterone administration due to his role in two debilitating strokes. The impact of the first stroke was intensified by the hospital staff's transphobic medical negligence."

        "title": "Untitled",
        "description": "From the portfolio Printed Matter Photography Portfolio I: Portraits (1994). This Cibachrome print was created in 1994. The artist frequented flea markets where he purchased hundreds of toys. In this photograph, toys were nestled together under covers in a private bedroom space, creating a feeling of intimacy enhanced by the family photo-album format. This quiet photograph translates the cultural experience of the AIDS epidemic into a personal reckoning with loss by creating an imagined reunion between those separated by disease."

        "title": "AIDS Stamp (Imagevirus)",
        "description": "Created in 1988, this lithograph design mimics pop art images of the 1960s that feature a striking contrast of color and punchy text. In particular, these stamps reference Robert Indiana's LOVE logo, which achieved ubiquity as a postage stamp in 1973. Drawn to the prevalence of Indiana's design in popular culture, the text was modified to read \"AIDS.\" Versions of the appropriated logo were created in different media including wallpaper, posters, sculptures, and stamps. By mimicking properties of viruses, such as mutation and repetition, this logo became a form of cultural virus and lent the project its name: Imagevirus. This technique served to challenge stigma and silence around HIV/AIDS."

        "title": "El Altar/Memoria Y Mortalidad",
        "description": "Created in 1994, this photograph features an elaborate set incorporating layered visual references such as a suspended chair, animal skulls, and burning flash papers. Studio portraits are arranged in a sequential grid and projected onto the scene, which is revealed by heavy, parted curtains. Made at a time when the artist was thinking deeply about his cultural identity, the work serves as a meditation on memory and mortality. The piece was created while documenting ten internment camps where approximately 120,000 individuals of Japanese descent were incarcerated by the U.S. government during World War II (1942-1945). The artist's parents were among those detained."

        "title": "Things Have Tears and We Know Suffering",
        "description": "Created in 1983-1984, this woodcut with oil paint on paper explores themes of childhood trauma and generational pain. The artwork features complex layered surfaces, symbols, and text. In the bottom right corner, there is a figure suckles an elongated breast dotted with patches of grey and purple flesh, while above it appears a chiseled stick figure symbolizing children's suffering. The surface treatment includes gouged lines creating a tearful effect, with carved text between linework referencing Virgil's Aeneid. Through these elements, the piece communicates a narrative about the transmission of wounds across generations, exploring themes of trauma, memory, and loss."

        "description": "From the series Our House is on Fire (2013), these digital prints capture portraits of individuals impacted by the Tahrir Square protests during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. The artwork features Farsi text overlaid on the subjects' faces, with the text pooling in the creases and wrinkles of their skin, suggesting they are inscribed with experience."

        "title": "Soldiers Search Bus Passengers Along the Northern Highway, El Salvador",
        "description": "This 1980 gelatin silver print documents human rights issues during the Salvadoran Civil War, which spanned approximately twelve years (1979-1992). As a freelance documentary photographer, the artist sought to raise awareness about atrocities committed during the war, while fostering dialogue about the U.S. role in these conflicts. In this image, political violence is implied through the tense shadows, leaving viewers uncertain and fearful for the safety of bus passengers."

        "title": "Una Reina del Circo or Disparate Puntual [A Queen of the Circus or Punctual Folly]",
        "description": "From the series Los Disparates [The Follies], this plate was engraved 1816-1828 and published 1877 using etching, aquatint, and paper. The images in Goya's series of \"follies\" work like puzzles, offering clues to the sayings they reference. Printed posthumously, the series visualizes foibles attributed to Spanish ruling parties, including the aristocracy, the Catholic Church, and the military. Here, the circus queen balances on horseback in front of a darkened crowd of spectators. The horse stands in precarity above the ground on a slackened tightrope, unable to move forward or backward. The Spanish saying referenced in the work, \"bailando en una cuerda floja\" (dancing on a slack rope), is often translated into the English expression \"skating on thin ice.\""

        "title": "Jazz",
        "description": "Created c. 1928 using ink, pen, graphite, and paper. Grosz's drawing depicts well-dressed people dancing to music performed by jazz musicians. Despite the lively nature of jazz, the dancers hold stiff postures with exaggerated features, highlighting a humorous disconnect. Jazz was introduced to Germany by Black American musicians during World War I (1914-1918) and became popular for its modernity, challenging traditional European genres."

        "title": "Reclining Figures: Ideas for Stone Sculptures",
        "description": "Created in 1944 using graphite pencil, wax crayon, chalk, wash, gouache, pen, ink, and paper. During World War II (1939-1945), Moore served as a war artist, capturing the atmosphere of life in London during the conflict. Many of his images were drawn from memory. These abstract reclining figures are based on his experiences in London Tube stations during the bombings. For Moore, this sight underscored the unity of Londoners in the face of wartime violence. Moore depicts sleeping Londoners sheltering in the underground station, their bodies rounded by blankets and clothing. Separated into hollows, the six reclining forms convey the feeling of hiding underground, waiting for an \"all clear.\" The soft white drapery covering the forms, and the yellow, glowing light adds eeriness to the scene. Moore also saw these as universal figures, shrouded in mystery."

        "title": "Confederate, Surrender",
        "description": "Created in 2022 using mixografia print on handmade paper. In this print, the artist reconstructs the handmade kitchen towel used as the Confederate Flag of Truce at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, signaling the end of the Civil War (1861-1865). The subtle waffle stitch of the flag set against a clouded blue sky prompts close and reflective looking. This differs vastly from the violent images that dominate U.S. national memory of the Civil War. Instead, the artwork elevates a symbol of peace as a living monument, calling attention to past and ongoing racial injustice in America. The piece asks viewers to consider new ways of remembering and reckoning with inequity and violence."
