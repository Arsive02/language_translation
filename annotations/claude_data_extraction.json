            "title": "GREEK EYES ON US",
            "description": "Around the late eighth century B.C.E. (800-701), Mediterranean cultures developed coinage. Soon after, coins were widely used and minted in as many as 700 independent poleis (Greek city-states). Some poleis used specific imagery, while others embraced variable designs depending on artists' and patrons' whimsy. This exhibit of 10 silver coins illustrates an especially engaging characteristic of ancient Greek coinage, eyes looking toward us, a direct personal connection infrequent in coinage of any era. It is delightful to return the gaze!",

            "description": "Coins in the ancient Roman world were art objects created in stages. Engravers carved the approved designs onto two dies, one for the obverse and a second for the reverse of each coin. The designs were struck by hand onto carefully weighed blank discs of gold, silver, bronze and other metals. The images and legends on every Roman coin relayed messages from government and mint officials. Since designs on Roman coins were created in response to contemporary events, and also used for political propaganda, Romans expected to see images on their money that combined familiar themes with new content. The art on Roman coins was akin to jewelry—immediate and intimate."

            "title": "ROMAN COINS THEMES",
            "description": "This exhibition highlights three themes of Roman coins: military success, religious piety and family. In ancient Rome, there was no separation of politics from the army or from religion. Military conquest and claims of divine favor were effective expressions of political power. Since many recipients of Roman coins were soldiers, these themes were selected to encourage loyalty among the troops. In addition, a Roman leader's status was promoted through familial connections, both human and divine."

            "description": "Andrea Gill creates ceramic vessels that comment on functionality by combining form and decoration. Gill's background in painting is evident in the decorative surfaces that accentuate the forms she creates. An inexpensive material, Gill uses earthenware exclusively to create two-dimensional surfaces for the decoration in each work. This tall, eccentric vase emphasizes the exchange of form and function, captivating the viewer with its elaborate design. Its earth-toned color palette alludes to the materiality of the vessel, and the floral decoration touches on the function of the vase. Gill's decoration develops during the creation of each piece—each step informing the next, adjusting to create harmony between form and surface.",

The essay content is confrontational, with some essays using language from ideological extremes to contradict others. Blending conceptual and street art, while adopting the techniques of manifestos and advertising, Holzer aimed to communicate directly with a wide audience."

Liu studied the animals and recalled: \"Inside the Dunhuang grottoes there are ancient Buddhist murals, always depicting apsaras—flying angels without wings. From some angles, the deer looked just like those apsaras caught in mid-flight ascending to heaven.\" Printed on three sheets, the artwork shows the fawns in a weightless, tumbling sequence. Each image is accompanied by a circle with trailing pigment drips. For Liu, these circles hold multiple meanings, symbolizing the cyclical nature of life and time, Zen Buddhist concepts of emptiness and completeness, and the full-stop circle in Chinese writing."

            "description": "From her 1991 breast cancer recurrence until her death in 2001, Sigler's artworks center her experience living with cancer. Here, Sigler conveys her lived experience through landscape. A roaring waterfall takes up the entirety of the print, overwhelming the composition with rushing water. The subtle shifts in the color of the falling water create a sense of power and movement, transporting viewers into the raging current. The meditative nature and force of the waterfall becomes a metaphor for accepting and letting go in the face of a terminal diagnosis."

Dugan's portrait of Black, queer love confronts histories of invisibility experienced by people in this community. Kelli and Jen's direct gazes assert that they stand together, united, while the yellow flowers in the background evoke joy and celebration."

In this photograph, he nestled two toys together under the covers, perhaps standing in for González-Torres and his partner Ross Laycock who died from HIV-related complications in 1991. By situating the scene in the private space of the bedroom, González-Torres creates a feeling of intimacy, further suggested by the image's family photo-album format. This quiet photograph translates the cultural experience of the AIDS epidemic into a personal reckoning with loss by creating an imagined reunion between lovers torn apart by disease."

            "description": "Grosz's drawing depicts well-dressed people dancing to music performed by jazz musicians. Despite the lively nature of jazz, the dancers hold stiff postures with exaggerated features, highlighting a humorous disconnect. Jazz was introduced to Germany by Black American musicians during World War I (1914-1918) and became popular for its modernity, challenging traditional European genres."

            "description": "During World War II (1939-1945), Moore served as a war artist, capturing the atmosphere of life in London during the conflict. Many of his images were drawn from memory. These abstract reclining figures are based on his experiences in London Tube stations during the bombings. For Moore, this sight underscored the unity of Londoners in the face of wartime violence. Moore depicts sleeping Londoners sheltering in the underground station, their bodies rounded by blankets and clothing. Separated into hollows, the six reclining forms convey the feeling of hiding underground, waiting for an \"all clear.\" The soft white drapery covering the forms, and the yellow, glowing light adds an eeriness to the scene. Moore also saw these as deathly figures, shrouded and buried."

            "description": "In this print, Clark reconstructs the handmade kitchen towel used as the Confederate Flag of Truce at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, signaling the end of the Civil War (1861-1865). The subtle waffle stitch of the flag set against a clouded blue sky prompts close and reflective looking. This differs vastly from the violent images that dominate U.S. national memory of the Civil War. Instead, Clark elevates a symbol of peace as a living monument, calling attention to past and ongoing racial injustice in America. Clark asks viewers to consider new ways of remembering and reckoning with inequity and violence."
